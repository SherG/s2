<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakejorgovan/" target="blank">Jake Jorgovan</a> of <a href="https://www.leadcookie.com/" target="blank">Lead Cookie</a> has put out an alert about a LinkedIn scam making the rounds. 

The scam starts with a message to your inbox asking you to download a PDF proposal. The link takes you to what looks like the Box.com site, but the URL is clearly not box.com. This mismatch between what looks like a well-known corporate site and a completely different URL is a tell-tale sign of a phishing scam. 

If you were to log into this fake site, the people behind the scam could potentially download all of your business/corporate documents.
