Yesterday <a href="https://bedford.io/team/trevor-bedford/" target="blank">Trevor Bedford</a>, a medical research scientist, <a href="https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1233970271318503426" target="blank">published on Twitter</a> some new findings on the Washington coronavirus (Covid-19) cases. 

Here are some of his takeaways: 

<ul><li>"This strongly suggests that there has been cryptic transmission in Washington State for the past 6 weeks."</li>
<li>"I believe we're facing an already substantial outbreak in Washington State that was not detected until now due to narrow case definition requiring direct travel to China." </li>
<li>"Our best current expectation is a few hundred current infections."</li></ul>

This  multiplicative effect isn't surprising given the incubation period and the fact that some carriers can be asymptomatic. A variety of infectious disease experts have indicated we can expect a rapid and significant uptick in cases. 

The collateral damage of the disease's spread, such as the stock market decline, is going to impact businesses and further disrupt supply chains. 

So what can you do to mitigate the potential damage to your business? Here's a short list. 

### Shift to Remote Work For Eligible Employees

Remote work can cut down on the risk of infections spreading. In metropolitan areas, many workers commute via public transportation, which would heighten their risk. 

An asymptomatic infected employee in the workplace for a few weeks can result in multiple employees having to take time off, denting your productivity. 

Also consider that if schools in your area close, some of your employees will need to be home anyway. 

Immediately assess how many of your employees can do their job from home. Make sure employee contact information is updated (including home and cell numbers).

#### Secure WiFi Connections

Draft a policy for use of company desktops or laptops at home. For example, you can require that public wifi networks never be used. If an employee wants to work from, say, a coffee shop, one day a week, they can obtain a mifi unit (such as Verizon's Jetpack) to access the internet securely. 

#### Tools For Remote Work

If you're not already set up with video confercing try Zoom or Google Hangouts. 

Slack can be a useful tool for communicating short, urgent messages with staff, but take care not to overpopulate your Slack account with too many channels, which will create chaos and inefficiency. 

Consider telling your employees about <a href="https://krisp.ai/" target="blank">Krisp.ai</a>, an app to remove background noise from calls. That's useful if they'll have background noise in their home or if they plan on working at another location, like a cafe, every so often.

### Protect Yourself From Insolvencies: Get Set Up With Invoice Factoring 

If you sell B2B or B2G (business to government) on 30-, 60-, or 90-day terms, you can sell your invoices for immediate cash. This process is called <a href="https://www.spearfishcap.com/services/invoice-factoring/" target="blank">invoice factoring</a> and it doesn't add any debt to your business. 

My other business, <a href="https://www.spearfishcap.com/" target="blank">Spearfish</a>, provides invoice factoring services for businesses earning a minimum of roughly $20k in average monthly revenue. 

#### Non-Recourse Factoring

We only provide non-recourse factoring: this means that credit risk insurance is added to your factoring account so that if your customer/vendor goes bankrupt within the factoring period you are not on the hook for the cash that was advanced to you. 

The credit risk insurance is obtained by our financial partner, who leverages their excellent credit rating to get the coverage at negligble cost. Protecting yourself with this type of insurance is smart move in periods before or during a recession. 

If you'd like to get set up with invoice factoring, <a href="https://calendly.com/spearfish/consultation?month=2020-03" target="blank">book an appointment</a> with me here. 

#### Supply Chain Financing: Get Paid Upfront For Large, Emergency Orders

If your business gets a bump in orders due to higher demand, invoice factoring and supply chain financing can make it easy for you to get paid in advance so that you can purchase the materials you need to fulfill those orders.

### Look for E-Commerce Opportunities

There are plenty of e-commerce opportunities that you can discover. 

For example, if you've been providing in-person seminars and workshops, create an immediate plan to deliver these online. If your in-person seminars are part of a sales funnel, shift the entirety of your funnel online and use a free webinar instead to attract customers. 

Consider using tools like <a href="https://www.clickfunnels.com/" target="blank">ClickFunnels</a> and <a href="https://home.webinarjam.com/index" target="blank">Webinar Jam</a>.

If your business provides a service, shift from in-person consultations to video or phone consultations. 

### Co-Working and Commercial Real Estate

Co-working will be a loser for at least the next several months. Once the virus emergency subsides, some business owners may decide that they'd prefer to have their employees continue to work remotely. 

Come Monday, if we continue to have additional significant declines in the markets, we may be in for a deep recession and possibly deflation. That can significantly impact commercial real estate rentals and sales.
